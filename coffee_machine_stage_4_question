Write a program that offers to buy one cup of coffee or to fill the supplies or to take its money out. Note that the program is supposed to do one of the mentioned actions at a time. It should also calculate how many ingredients and money have left. Display the number of supplies before and after purchase.

First, your program reads one option from the standard input, which can be "buy", "fill", "take". If a user wants to buy some coffee, the input is "buy". If a special worker thinks that it is time to fill out all the supplies for the coffee machine, the input line will be "fill". If another special worker decides that it is time to take out the money from the coffee machine, you'll get the input "take".
If the user writes "buy" then they must choose one of three types of coffee that the coffee machine can make: espresso, latte, or cappuccino.
For one espresso, the coffee machine needs 250 ml of water and 16 g of coffee beans. It costs $4.
For a latte, the coffee machine needs 350 ml of water, 75 ml of milk, and 20 g of coffee beans. It costs $7.
And for a cappuccino, the coffee machine needs 200 ml of water, 100 ml of milk, and 12 g of coffee. It costs $6.
If the user writes "fill", the program should ask them how much water, milk, coffee beans and how many disposable cups they want to add into the coffee machine.
If the user writes "take" the program should give all the money that it earned from selling coffee.
At the moment, the coffee machine has $550, 1200 ml of water, 540 ml of milk, 120 g of coffee beans, and 9 disposable cups.

To sum up, your program should print the coffee machine's state, process one query from the user, as well as print the coffee machine's state after that. Try to use functions for implementing every action that the coffee machine can do.
Examples
An espresso should be as number 1 in the list, a latte as number 2 and a cappuccino as number 3.
Options are named as "buy", "fill", "take".

The greater-than symbol followed by space (> ) represents the user input. Notice that it's not the part of the input.
